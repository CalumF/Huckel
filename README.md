General huckel calculator

Usage:

Enter the number of carbon atoms on prompt, then enter the connectivity. This is done by labelling the carbons and entering a fully connected path as a comma separated list. Any paths branching from this are entered after a space in the same way (without repeating parts of the previous path). For a cycle the first and last value will be the same. 

E.g. toluene cation - "1,2,3,4,5,6 1,7"
